# Update Mona's GitHub Info website

Read `notes/mona-notes.md` before making changes.

Use these sources:

- `notes/mona-notes.md`
- GitHub Blog: https://github.blog/latest/
- GitHub Changelog: https://github.blog/changelog/
- Awesome Copilot: https://awesome-copilot.github.com/

Use web-fetch to read https://awesome-copilot.github.com/.

Update `site/content/github-info.md` with concise,
practical updates for readers and include source context when content comes
from the GitHub Blog or GitHub Changelog.

Open a pull request for Mona to review.
Use a pull request title that mentions Mona or GitHub Info.
Do not write directly to `main`;
rely on `safe-outputs` with `create-pull-request`.
